# Updated Research Proposal: Affordable Housing and Community Health Proximity to Green Space in LA
### By Mica O'Brien and Estefany Garcia 

## Research Question & Background:

As a group, we are interested in better understanding the affordable housing landscape throughout Los Angeles and assessing if residents of affordable housing have access to health promoting amenities nearby, specifically parks. This research is important because affordable housing developments are permanent and costly. We need to assess the effectiveness of site placement and whether they are maximizing local infrastructure that can support the wellbeing of residents.  Parks have been proven to decrease air pollution and improve the mental health of people that liven near them. For this reason, all residents deserve access to green space. 


**We will explore the following research questions:** 

1. Are existing affordable housing developments located near parks in the City of Los Angeles? 
2. What is the average distance between affordable housing developments and parks in Los Angeles? 
3. How does this distance compare to that of various racial demographic groups living in market rate housing?

## Data Sources

We will be using three datasets to approach our research questions. The [first dataset](https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/lahub::affordable-housing-development/about) is from Los Angeles GeoHub and includes all affordable housing developments across Los Angeles. The [second dataset](https://data.lacity.org/Parks-Recreation/Department-of-Recreation-and-Parks-GIS-Map-of-Park/nuub-r4zx) is the Department of Recreation and Parks' data on park boundaries in Los Angeles. We will also use census data on racial demographics by census tract. This will enable us to explore similarities and differences in access to green space by Angelenos of different racial backgrounds.

## Analysis and Visualizations

We will use the data described above to determine the average proximity of affordable housing to green space in Los Angeles. To begin, we will map the racial demographics of the Westside of Los Angeles vs. Downtown Los Angeles. We will also create a baseline map with markers indicating the exact location of affordable housing developments in Los Angeles (using the Los Angeles GeoHub dataset) and possibly using isochrones to show the distance from affordable housing to parks. We may also create a loop that allows us to calculate the distance between each affordable housing development and its nearest park. This would enable us to calculate the average distance from affordable housing developments and parks across the city. Lastly, we will use census data to explore the racial demographics of neighborhoods where affordable housing developments are located and assess access to parks by census tracts. 

## Conclusion

With our research, we hope to better understand the effectiveness of affordable housing by assessing its location. It is important for us to understand how accessible health promoting amenities are to the residents of these developments. We believe this tool can also potentially uplift a gap in community development. We hope this resource can help inform new policies and practices necessary to center equity when identifying new affordable housing locations.
