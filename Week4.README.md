# Week 4: Mica and Estefany's Final Project Update

### Project title and link to proposal
Affordable Housing and Community Health: https://github.com/estefanyines/GroupProject_UP206A/tree/main/Group%20Assignments 

### Roles
**Mica**: Mica will start by exploring the affordable housing dataset from Los Angeles GeoHub. She will clean the data as needed and experiment with spatial joins with Census and neighborhood data. She will pull summary statistics on the location of affordable housing developments and demographic trends (using Census data) across the city. 

**Estefany**: Estefany will be focusing on green space data provided by healthdata.gov that focuses on residents living within half a mile of either parks, beach, open space or coastline. She will also track the racial demographics of access, which is included in the dataset. 

**Mica & Estefany**: Mica and Estefany will work together to complete a spatial join of the affordable housing and green space datasets and analyze findings. We will also divide writing tasks evenly between us. 

### Status update
The team is proactive about going to office hours together and having good communication on how the research exploration and coding is going. A strength of the team is our flexibility - we are open to changing our research question/specifics based on the availability and quality of data. So far we are in the early stages of exploring our primary data sources, refining our research question, and thinking through possible visualizations.

### Data update
After meeting with Ryan to discuss our project status, we have decided to limit our scope and use of datasets. We will continue to use the [affordable housing development dataset](https://geohub.lacity.org/datasets/affordable-housing-development/explore?location=34.023738%2C-118.404263%2C10.00) from Los Angeles GeoHub and the [California Department of Health dataset](https://healthdata.gov/State/Park-Beach-Open-Space-or-Coastline-Access/h6ng-xwua/data) on access to open space. We have decided to omit the access to grocery stores dataset for now and have identified a dataset on pollution exposure as a backup.

With Ryan’s help, we have decided to select a comparison group using the California Department of Health dataset. We will compare open space access for residents of affordable housing developments with that of the average Angeleno of different race and income backgrounds, which is included in the California Department of Health dataset. We believe this will better enable us to answer our research question: how does access to open space among residents of affordable housing developments compare to that of residents of market rate housing? 

As of now, we have begun exploring the affordable housing dataset as part of the Week 4 homework assignment. We will turn to the access to open space dataset next.

### Concerns 
**Major concerns**: We are concerned about successfully implementing the spatial joins between the two datasets and extracting meaningful findings. We are also unsure of the best way to visualize/map the joined datasets. An isochrone map may be the best way to visualize access to open space among affordable housing and non-affordable housing residents, but we are not yet confident in this approach. We are open to other ways of visualizing our findings and may want to experiment with a couple different approaches. 

**Minor concerns**: We still feel very new to GIS and are unsure of what is possible to create in Python. We expect to gain new ideas from labs and will also explore projects from last quarter to get a sense of what’s possible.
